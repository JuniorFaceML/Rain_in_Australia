# Rain_in_Australia

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to conduct an analysis and build a classification model to predict rain for the next day in Australia. An analysis was performed, and rows with missing values were removed since there was no way to fill them in. A robust model was built with a Accuracy metric of nearly 95%. Another objective was to create a model with better metrics than those of other respondents, which has been achieved.
